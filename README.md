### Codes for the AI6127 course at NTU

#### lang_model:

A simple language model using basic feed-forward neural network, as proposed in the *A neural probabilistic language model* paper [(Bengio, et. al. 2013)](#references)

#### NER:

CNN_BiLSTM_CRF NER tagging system as proposed by [Ma and Hovy. 2016](#references)
Implementation of which was based on [this github repo](https://github.com/jayavardhanr/End-to-end-Sequence-Labeling-via-Bi-directional-LSTM-CNNs-CRF-Tutorial)
